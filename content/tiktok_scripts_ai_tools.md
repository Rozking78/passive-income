I was spending more time creating than actually
running my business.

Then someone showed me Jasper.

I didn't believe it at first.
But I tried it.

[Pause]

First month, I got 20 hours of my life back.
My content actually got BETTER.
And I stopped dreading sitting down to write."

Try it yourself.
Free trial, link in bio."

Because it takes 10 minutes now, not 2 hours."

"Engagement went UP 40%.
Because I had time to actually respond to comments."

From content the AI helped me write."

[THE POINT]

You can try it free."
```

## BONUS HOOKS (Mix & Match)

## FILMING TIPS

1. **First 1-2 seconds are everything** - Hook must stop the scroll
2. **Show, don't just tell** - Screen recordings perform better
3. **Talk like a friend** - Not salesy, just sharing what works
4. **Add captions** - 80% watch without sound
5. **End with soft CTA** - "Link in bio" not "BUY NOW"
6. **Post 1-3x daily** - Volume wins on TikTok
7. **Reply to every comment** - Algorithm loves engagement
8. **Use trending sounds** - When relevant
